# Deployment to AWS using ECS, RDS and S3

## Building and Deploying Docker Image
1. **Build Docker Image:**
   - Create and build the Docker image for the Django application.

2. **Tag Docker Image:**
   - Tag the Docker image with the appropriate ECR repository URI.

3. **Push Docker Image to Amazon ECR:**
   - Create an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) repository.
   - Push the Docker image to the ECR repository.

## Configuring ECS for Deployment

1. **Create ECS Fargate Cluster:**
   - Set up an Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) cluster using Fargate

2. **Define ECS Task Definition and Service:**
   - Create an ECS task definition that references the Docker image in ECR.
   - Configure task roles, container definitions, and resource requirements.
   - Configure task service to use the appropriate load balancer for handling incoming traffic.

## Managing Secrets

**Store Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager:**
   - Store sensitive information such as database credentials and API keys in AWS Secrets Manager.
   - Configure ECS tasks to retrieve secrets securely from Secrets Manager.

## Database Deployment

**Setup Amazon RDS:**
   - Create an Amazon RDS instance with PostgreSQL for persistent storage.
   - Configure security groups to allow access from ECS tasks.
   - Ensure proper configuration for secure communication between ECS and the RDS instance.

## Data Storage Solution and Data Ingestion

 **Store Ingestion Data on Amazon S3:**
   - Create an Amazon S3 bucket for storing text files and other data.
   - Configure the Django application and ECS tasks to use S3 to read the text files and ingest data in RDS


## Conclusion

- This approach provides a scalable and manageable and serverless deployment solution for your Django application and data ingestion tasks.
- Leveraging Amazon ECR, ECS, Secrets Manager, RDS, and S3 allows for efficient image management, secure secret handling, scalable application deployment, and effective data storage.
